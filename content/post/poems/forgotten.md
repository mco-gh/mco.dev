Soldiers on tiktok,  
Dancing on death  
With glee celebrate  
A baby's last breath  
  
<!--more-->  
  
Reducing a people  
To rubble and mud  
Without hesitation  
They call for more blood  
  
With heads in the sand,  
Reality denied.  
The whole world watches  
Televised genocide  
  
These soldiers are children  
Of those killed en masse  
In brutal detention  
and poisonous gas  

Do they not understand  
We are part of a chain  
Can they not in their hearts  
Remember that pain?  

For their's is a story  
Of hearts become rotten  
But now they behave   
As if they've forgotten
