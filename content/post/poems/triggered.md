In the darkness of night  
When the world feels askew  
I scroll through the news  
And I'm outraged anew  

<!--more-->  

I see things that make  
My heart want to weep  
And night after night  
I struggle to sleep  

They tell me stop scrolling  
It does you no good  
Your naive conclusions  
Are misunderstood

It's older than you  
We've always been hated  
You think this is simple  
But it's complicated.  

Are you not able  
To just get along?  
We support Israel  
And sadly, you're wrong  

You needn't tell us  
WhatÂ we should know  
We've asked you to stop  
We'll pray for you though

They don't understand  
At the end of the day  
That I'm simply unable  
To just look away 

The bombs that they drop  
Don't care who they kill  
And the dreams they destroy  
Forever are still  

Perhaps it does something  
To help me survive  
For when I speak out  
I know I'm alive  

So I think I'll keep sharing  
The thoughts in my head  
Cause I'd rather be triggered  
Than emotionally dead.
