Our memories are what make us who we are. They are the building blocks of our identity. I feel sad when I think about how many little details of my life I can't remember.

I took December off to recharge and I'm back to my weekly posts. I hope you had some much needed downtime as well and I wish you a peaceful and fulfilling 2025. Now to the subject of today's post...

Our memories are what make us who we are. They are the building blocks of our identity. I feel sad when I think about how many little details of my life I can't remember. 

I've had this idea for a while about wearing a tiny, non-intrusive camera that records a livestream video of your life from your own first person vantage point. Then you could use AI to extract and relive the most significant moments. On the surface, that might sound like a good idea but it raises so many privacy and misuse concerns that I don't think I would want to use such a service.

Today's One Great Thing is related to this theme. It's a beautiful New York Times video about an artist who used his art to capture the significant events of his life. Watch this short video and see if it inspires you to spend a little time capturing the most important moments of your life, not with technology, but by using your creativity, whether it be writing, drawing, photography, or any other medium you enjoy.
