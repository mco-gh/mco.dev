Todayâ€™s one great thing is a short article about a powerful life hack everyone should know about.

<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mooreds.com/wordpress/archives/3518">Ask for no, don't ask for yes</a> is a simple technique which will save you time, effort, and mental anguish in the long run. It's about phrasing your questions in a way such that you solicit feedback but, if none is forthcoming, you are free to implement your idea.

This concept is closely related to one of my favorite rules and one which has served me well in my career: it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. But "Don't ask for no" strikes a balance between those two extremes, giving your approver(s) the opportunity to weigh in, but biasing you toward taking action.

This article is based in a professional enginering context, but I think this technique applies in many diverse situations in life. The next time you're tempted to ask for permission to do something you pretty much know is a good idea but wouldn't mind some confirmation or feedback, try asking for no.
