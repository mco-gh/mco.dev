I'm down with any initiative that encourages book people to hang out with other book people.

In 2018, Mackenzie Newcomb founded the Bad Bitch Book Club. Turbo-charged by the isolation we all experienced during the Pandemic, by 2020 the club had grown to 38,000 members. But something was missing - club meetings were an online only experience, and this prompted a brilliant idea: the Bad Bitch Book Club Summer Camp is an annual *physical* gathering of club members at a camp in The Forks, Maine.

It features all the trappings of a kid's camp experience: living in rustic cabins, barbeques, campfires and s'mores, swimming, a talent show, etc. but the main attraction is, you guessed it, **reading**. There are book swaps, book discussion groups, book recommendation sharing, book crafts, and of course, lots of reading. 

What a great idea! I'd love to attend this camp but it's limited to bad bitches. Maybe it's time to start the Dope Dudes Book Club.
