I've been teaching a class at the University of Surrey in South London. During a recent lab session, a student approached me with a question   and I noticed the most exquisite hand-written diagram and caligraphy I've ever seen.

Handwriting feels like such an ananchronism. I was so taken by this beautiful notebook that I asked to photograph a random page, which you see above. A few days later, the student asked if I have a favorite short poem and I shared one that was meaningful from my childhood.

The next time I saw him, he produced not one, but four of the most exquisite renderings of my chosen verse. I've shared them in the video below because they have to be seen to be believed. I'm going to have one or more (maybe all) of them framed.

What a kind gesture and what a lovely nod to an earlier era, when people wrote with their hands and took pride in the results.
