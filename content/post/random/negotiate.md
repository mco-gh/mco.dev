This <a target="_blank" href="">well crafted article</a> is full of great advice for anyone in the position of negotiating a job offer.

<!--more-->

For many people, it's not even obvious this is a negotiable transaction. Someone offers you a job and you take it, or not, right? Hasseeb makes the point that you're not trying to "get" a job. You're trying to sell your labor to a company that will compensate you fairly. And not just monetarily, but along the dimensions that are most meaningful to you.

This two-part article puts the whole process into perspective and provides an invaluable lesson on how to navigate a critically important process.

I'll add one rule to Hasseeb's list of 10: always be willing to walk away. If you feel like you simply can't afford to turn down an offer, you've already lost. Of course, you want to stay positive, but you're not in this to sell your soul and your strongest card is the knowledge that f things aren't right, you can walk away.
