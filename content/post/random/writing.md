I've been journaling every morning for the last several weeks and have found it to be a very helpful way to organize my thoughts and process some of the many loose threads in my mind.

In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/03/morning-pages-change-your-life-oliver-burkeman">Morning Pages</a>, Oliver Burkeman explains why daily journaling, sometimes called "Morning Pages" is so helpful.

He recommends producing three sides of a page each day but I don't like the length requirement because some mornings I have a lot to write about, others not so much. I prefer to use a time spent requirement and I keep it very short, so as to maintain a low bar to taking action. If this is going to be a daily activity, it's important to make it as painless as possible. 

So my formula is ten minutes of writing every morning, which so far has been surprisingly easy to do. One thing that often suprises me is I'll start out writing about subject X and the entry will organically transform itself into subject Y. It's like my unconsicous mind knows what it really wants to talk about.

A few tips I recommend if you try this:

0. Don't overplan. Let the writing just flow as freely as possible. Don't worry if it makes sense or is well written. This is by you and for you. No one has to ever see it so start by writing free about whatever pops into your head.

1. Write in longhand. It's now been scientifically proven that writing with your hand activates a different part of your brain versus using a keyboard, resulting in more creativity and greater retention. I swear by my Remarkable Tablet, which faithfully preserves the age old handwriting experience in the digital age.

2. Write first thing, or at least relatively early, in the morning. There's something about that feeling when you wake up where your brain has sort of rebooted itself and you have a fresh outlook on life. I also like that when I get this done early, it's not hanging over me for the rest of the day.

3. Start every new session by reading what you wrote the day before. This gives a sort of continuity of thought that we sometimes miss in our everyday busy lies.

In short, I find this process is fun and helps with my stability and mental health. It costs nothing bit a short slice of my morning and it's a lot cheaper than therapy.
