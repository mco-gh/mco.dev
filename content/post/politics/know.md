I know many Jewish people who feel very strongly about Palestinians, yet have never met one. Think about that. If this describes you, it means you’re holding judgments about 15 million human beings without a single personal encounter.

<!--more-->  

It’s easy to form opinions about people from a distance. But once you meet someone, even briefly, something changes. They stop being a flat stereotype and become a real person - complex, imperfect, and human, just like the rest of us.

So I want to make a simple proposal to my Jewish friends, relatives, and readers:

> **Get to know one Palestinian.**

No politics required. No heavy debates. In fact, I’d suggest you avoid those topics at first. You don’t need to become close friends. Just meet one person and connect with them on a human level.

You might wonder: How would I even do that?

It’s easier than you think. Palestinians live everywhere. They are coworkers, neighbors, students, business owners, classmates’ parents, and fellow commuters. If you truly don’t know where to start, reach out to a local mosque or Islamic community center. I’m sure you will find them welcoming and happy to help you connect.

Forming opinions about any group without knowing a single member is unfair and ultimately dehumanizing. If you care about the truth, you owe it to yourself to meet at least one Palestinian.

It might change more than you expect.
