I have a treat for you today. NPR’s Tiny Desk Concerts regularly hosts a diverse array of amazing artists performing in an intimate setting, literally behind a tiny desk, to an impromptu gathering of staffers (for the concerts alone, I’d give anything to work there).

Today I’m sharing one song that I particularly love from this series. Watch Alicia Keys perform an acoustic version of Underdog, featuring rich vocals, a powerful message, and a beautiful vibe overall. Enjoy!
