Check out this beautifully crafted, inspiring, award-winning short film. It tells the story of Madeleine, a spirited 106 year old woman who reluctantly travels to the beach with her young filmmaker friend.

The opening frame tells us:

> This film’s dialogues were recorded over the course of 5 years, between two friends born 67 years apart and 8,000 km away.

I love how the story seamlessly transitions between stop motion animation and live action sequences. It’s part fantasy and part reality. View the video below and see if you don’t fall in love with Madeleine.
