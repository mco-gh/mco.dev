I just watched a documentary that touched my heart and outraged me at the same time.

It’s the tale of Pasha Talankin, who, as the official videographer for a primary school in a small industrial town in Russia, finds himself becoming the unwitting propagandist for the “special military operation” in Ukraine. Instead of resigning in dismay, Pasha uses his video camera to give us an undercover glimpse of how Russian public schools have been transformed into centers of childhood indoctrination.

It’s a poignant and courageous tale of a young man who loves his job, his country, and his people, but risks everything to ask the difficult questions. It serves as a cautionary tale for Americans, as we see books banned, universities silenced, and a continual slide toward authoritarianism.

This is not just a story about Russia - it’s a reminder of how fragile the freedoms we take for granted really are. Check out the trailer below.
