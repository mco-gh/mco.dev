<p> 
I'm an American software engineer based in London.
My mission is building tools, tutorials, and online courses to help make computing, mathematics, and data science more accessible and more inclusive.

<!--more-->

I have a Master of Engineering degree in Computer Science from Cornell University and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics from Rutgers University, and over 40 years of experience as a professional software developer and engineering manager at Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies, and Google.

I've taught, as an instructor or guest lecturer, at numerous universities in the US and UK. I have three patents and co-authored an O'Reilly book on Google Compute Engine. My primary professional interests are Python Programming, Applied Mathematics, Web Development, Machine Learning/AI, Data Science, and Cloud Computing.

Other things I'm interested in:

* productivity and study hacks
* playing guitar
* puzzles, chess, and bridge
* great books, music, theater, and films (especially documentaries)
