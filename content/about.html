      I'm a Developer Advocate at Google. I build tools, demos, codelabs, and other things to make the <a href="https://cloud.google.com">Google Cloud Platform</a>
      easier and more fun to use. I'm originally from New Jersey, lived in Columbus and Seattle for a while, and now live and work in London, UK.  I co-authored a
      book about <a href="https://bit.ly/gce-book">Google Compute Engine</a> and
      wrote the
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPtJd6AzU8c&feature=youtu.be&t=39m19s">product announcement demo</a>.
      In a previous life, I developed communication systems at 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">Bell Labs</a>
      and Lucent Technologies. Outside of work, I enjoy indie music, quirky 
      films (especially documentaries), books, puzzles, and chess. I'm also
      very interested in education, teaching, and applying technology (like 
      <a href="https://www.oskarth.com/srspractice/">spaced repetition</a>)
      to enhance the learning experience.
